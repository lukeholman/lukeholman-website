I'm a lecturer in the [Animal and Plant Science Research Group](https://www.napier.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-search/centres/animal-and-plant-science-research-group) at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/). I mostly study the evolution and genetics of sex, sociality and communication. I combine empirical work on insects such as _Drosophila_ and social Hymenoptera (bees/ants/wasps) with theoretical models, 'omics, meta-analysis, and text mining. I am also the Reviews Editor for _[Journal of Evolutionary Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14209101)_. I'm a big fan of open and reproducible science, and so I often write detailed reports [like this](https://lukeholman.github.io/queen-pheromone-RNAseq/) to help share my methods.
