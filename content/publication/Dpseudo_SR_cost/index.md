abstract = "Selfish 'meiotic drive' alleles are transmitted to more than 50% of offspring, allowing them to rapidly invade populations even if they reduce the fitness of individuals carrying them. Theory predicts that drivers should either fix or go extinct, yet some drivers defy these predictions by persisting at low, stable frequencies for decades. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that drivers are especially costly when homozygous, although empirical tests of this idea are rare and equivocal. Here, we measure the fitness of female _Drosophila pseudoobscura_ carrying zero, one or two copies of the X-linked driver sex ratio (_SR_). _SR_ had strong negative effects on female offspring production and the probability of reproductive failure, and these effects were largely similar across four genetic backgrounds. _SR_ was especially costly when homozygous. We used our fitness measurements to parametrize a population genetic model, and found that the female fitness costs observed here can explain the puzzlingly low allele frequency of _SR_ in nature. We also use the model to show how spatial variation in female mating behaviour, fitness costs of _SR_ and the reduced siring success of _SR_ males can jointly explain the northâ€“south cline in _SR_ frequencies across North America."

summary = "We measured the effects of a natural gene drive, _Sex Ratio_ (_SR_), on fitness in _Drosophila pseudoobscura_. We find that _SD_ is very costly, especially when homozygous, and that it also has transgenerational effects on offspring fitness and sex ratio. Using a model, we show that these effects may explain the frequency and clinal patterns of _SR_ in nature."
