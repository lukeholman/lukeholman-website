      <description>We find that researchers tend to co-publish with same-gendered colleagues, and that this tendency is presently increasing. We found no evidence that senior academics drive this pattern, or that the pattern is stronger in fields where women are in the minority. Interestingly, journals with a high impact factor for their discipline tended to have comparatively many mixed-gender teams.</description>

      <title>Sexual selection improves population fitness: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title>

      <description>We synthesised 459 effect sizes from 65 pertinent experimental evolution studies using meta-analysis, and found that sexual selection on males tends to elevate the mean and reduce the variance for many fitness traits. The beneficial effect was stronger in female traits than males, and for populations evolving under stressful conditions. The results have implications for conservation and captive breeding programs.</description>

      <title>The gender gap in science: how long until women are equally represented?</title>

      <description>We recorded the gender of 36 million authors from &amp;gt;100 countries publishing in &amp;gt;6000 journals from most STEMM, and made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://lukeholman.github.io/genderGap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt; facilitating exploration of the data. Despite recent progress, the gender gap appears likely to persist for generations.</description>
