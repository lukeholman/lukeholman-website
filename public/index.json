I am especially interested in queen pheromones that cause other colony members to become sterile, because reproductive division of labour is the defining \u0026ndash; and most evolutionarily striking \u0026ndash; characteristic of the social insects.\nI have been working on queen pheromones since 2008, when I conducted the first experimental bioassay to identify a queen pheromone from an ant (the black garden ant, Lasius niger). In a series of follow-up papers, we showed that the queen pheromone signals the fecundity and condition and of the queen, suggesting that it is an \u0026lsquo;honest signal\u0026rsquo; of the queen\u0026rsquo;s value to the workers. That is, the workers probably \u0026lsquo;choose\u0026rsquo; to remain sterile when they perceive the presence of a healthy queen, since it is more profitable for them to reproduce indirectly by helping to raise the queen\u0026rsquo;s young (who are usually the workers\u0026rsquo; brothers and sisters).\nLater on, I co-discovered the first queen pheromone for a bumblebee and a wasp, in collaboration with Tom Wenseleers and colleagues. The queen pheromones of most ants, wasps and bees are quite similar, which is surprising given that these three groups evolved their eusocial societies independently, and have been evolving independently for well over 100 million years. This suggests that queen pheromones evolved from some sort of chemical signal (such as a sex pheromone signaling egg production) that was already present in the solitary insects that were the common ancestors of the eusocial Hymenoptera.\nMy most recent work focuses on the transcriptomic effects of queen pheromones. As one might expect of a pheromone that profoundly alters the behaviour and physiology of workers exposed to it, we find that queen pheromones affect the expression of a great many genes. We found striking similarity in the genetic circuits targetted by queen pheromones in bees and ants, which are separated by 150 million years of independent evolution.\n","date":1535438437,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535438437,"objectID":"f7efbd2cdd93028e06c16d292a2526f8","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/project/queen_pheromones/","publishdate":"2018-08-28T16:40:37+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/queen_pheromones/","section":"project","summary":"Research on the identity, mode of action, and evolution of social insect queen pheromones","tags":["Queen pheromones"],"title":"Queen pheromones","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have written on \u0026lsquo;p-hacking\u0026rsquo;, the phenomenon wherby people fudge the numbers in various ways in order to get the coveted p \u0026lt; 0.05.

Gene drives can work in a variety of ways, including destroying sperm cells that do not carry them, biasing meiosis in females, or gene conversion (which essentially converts drive heterozygotes into homozygotes).\nRecently, it has become possible to artificially create gene drives using genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9. These artificial drives could be used in the near future to genetically engineer or eradicate populations of wild organisms (e.g. to prevent the spread of malaria). However, gene drive research still has many hurdles \u0026ndash; technological, regulatory, and ethical \u0026ndash; to overcome. Aside from the challenging lab work needed to build a functional gene drive, many issues remain unresolved. Will populations evolve resistance to gene drives, or will they spread indefinitely? Can we make truly safe and self-limiting genes, which will remain restricted to the release site or go extinct once their job is done?

Typically, queens are long-lived egg-layers, while workers are short-lived, largely sterile foragers. Remarkably, the two castes are nevertheless produced by the same genome. The existence of inter-caste genetic correlations is a neglected consequence of this shared genome, potentially hindering the evolution of caste dimorphism: alleles that increase the productivity of queens may decrease the productivity of workers and vice versa, such that each caste is prevented from reaching optimal trait values. A likely consequence of this ‘intralocus caste antagonism’ should be the maintenance of genetic variation for fitness and maladaptation within castes (termed ‘caste load’), analogous to the result of intralocus sexual antagonism. The aim of this review is to create a research framework for understanding caste antagonism, drawing in part upon conceptual similarities with sexual antagonism. By reviewing both the social insect and sexual antagonism literature, we highlight the current empirical evidence for caste antagonism, discuss social systems of interest, how antagonism might be resolved, and challenges for future research. We also introduce the idea that sexual and caste antagonism could interact, creating a three-way antagonism over gene expression. This includes unpacking the implications of haplodiploidy for the outcome of this complex interaction.","tags":["Social insects","Evolutionary conflict"],"title":"Building a new research framework for social evolution: Intralocus caste antagonism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Frances Jacomb"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503818913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503818913,"objectID":"eb3dafbaa2491dea7bc98627d5426300","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/publication/stress_and_sex/","publishdate":"2017-08-27T17:28:33+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/stress_and_sex/","section":"publication","summary":"The capacity of a population to adapt to selection (evolvability) depends on whether the structure of genetic variation permits the evolution of fitter trait combinations.

Here, we estimate selection, genetic (co)variance and evolvability in both sexes of Tribolium castaneum flour beetles under stressful and benign conditions, using a half‐sib breeding design. Although stress uncovered substantial latent heritability, stress also affected genetic covariance, such that evolvability remained low under stress.

Consequently, sexual selection on males augmented adaptation in females, and intralocus sexual conflict was weak or absent.

An enduring puzzle concerns why some meiotic drivers persist at stable, intermediate frequencies rather than sweeping to fixation. Drivers can have a wide range of consequences from extinction to changes in mating system. Meiotic drivers are genetic variants that selfishly manipulate the production of gametes to increase their own rate of transmission, often to the detriment of the rest of the genome and the individual that carries them. This genomic conflict potentially occurs whenever a diploid organism produces a haploid stage, and can have profound evolutionary impacts on gametogenesis, fertility, individual behaviour, mating system, population survival, and reproductive isolation.

Consequently, the driving chromosome's relative fitness should decline, halting or reversing its spread. We used formal modeling to show that this initially appealing hypothesis cannot resolve the puzzle alone: other selective pressures (e.g., low fitness of drive homozygotes) are required to establish a stable meiotic drive polymorphism.

Male fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi, court females with a stereotyped claw-waving display, and males are often observed waving in synchrony with nearby claw-waving males. Using female mate preference experiments with robots that imitate male claw waves, we found evidence that females are more attracted to males whose waves immediately precede a synchronous group of waves (leaders); females also favoured males that waved in opposite phase to a synchronous group (alternators). By contrast, males whose waves lagged behind a group of synchronous wavers (laggards) were no more attractive. We discuss a simple sensory process that could explain how this female preference arises. Our results agree with past findings suggesting that synchrony in fiddler crabs occurs as an epiphenomenon of adaptive male responses to female preferences.","tags":["Sexual selection"],"title":"Female preferences for timing in a fiddler crab with synchronous courtship waving displays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Thomas A.R.

In many species they are key to the maintenance of reproductive division of labor, with workers beginning to reproduce individually once the queen pheromone disappears. Recently, a queen pheromone that negatively affects worker fecundity was discovered in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, presenting an exciting opportunity for comparisons with analogous queen pheromones in independently-evolved eusocial lineages such as honey bees, ants, wasps and termites. I set out to replicate this discovery and verify its reproducibility. Using blind, controlled experiments, I found that n-pentacosane (C25) does indeed negatively affect worker ovary development. Moreover, the pheromone affects both large and small workers, and applies to workers from large, mature colonies as well as young colonies. Given that C25 is readily available and that bumblebees are popular study organisms, I hope that this replication will encourage other researchers to tackle the many research questions enabled by the discovery of a queen pheromone.","tags":["Social insects","Queen pheromones"],"title":"Bumblebee size polymorphism and worker response to queen pheromone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maja Babis","Luke Holman","Ricarda Fenske","Melissa L.

Here, we tested whether queens’ cuticular lipids could provide reliable signals of fertility in the honeybee Apis mellifera, as they do in other social Hymenoptera. Specifically, we tested whether cuticular lipids differ between virgin queens of different ages, and between queens exposed to different artificial insemination treatments being semen (sperm and seminal fluid), seminal fluid only or saline control. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we found 27 lipids: 21 different hydrocarbons, namely alkanes, alkenes and dienes, as well as six wax esters. The lipid profile changed dramatically in the first 10 days after eclosion, and there were differences in lipid composition between virgin and artificially inseminated queens. Insemination with semen, seminal fluid or saline did not result in distinct chemical profiles. Our findings indicate that the physical stimulus of insemination was responsible for the observed changes in the cuticular profile in honeybee queens. Our results demonstrate that cuticular lipid profiles encode information on queen age, fertility and mating status, which could in principle be utilised by workers and rival queens.","tags":["Social insects","Queen pheromones"],"title":"Cuticular lipids correlate with age and insemination status in queen honeybees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Hanna Kokko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409204289,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409204289,"objectID":"2caff25f335554f1e67a17e0be043494","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/publication/gxe_chapter/","publishdate":"2014-08-28T15:38:09+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gxe_chapter/","section":"publication","summary":"This book chapter presents a theoretical model looking at the evolution of female choice when male condition is determined by gene-by-environment interactions (GxEs).

When mated females disperse alone to a new habitat, their offspring may have no option but to mate with their siblings and incur inbreeding depression. However, some of the offspring of polyandrous females may only be half siblings, reducing inbreeding depression when isolated groups of siblings only have each other as mates. We investigated this putative benefit of polyandry over monandry by initiating multiple genetically isolated populations of Callosobruchus maculatus beetles, each founded by a single female, who received a complete ejaculate from either one or two males. The early generations had comparable fitness, but the F4 and F5 descendants of doubly inseminated females were more numerous and had higher egg‐to‐adult survival than the descendants of singly inseminated females. This fitness benefit was of similar magnitude whether beetles were reared on their standard food plant, or on a less favourable food source. Our results suggest that polyandrous females produce fitter descendants in inbred founder populations and therefore that polyandry may affect movement ecology and invasion biology.","tags":["Sexual selection"],"title":"Polyandrous females found fitter populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Hanna Kokko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409203154,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409203154,"objectID":"6d3c439a4532bab1e3eaf96790f9ba09","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/publication/imprinting_review/","publishdate":"2014-08-28T15:19:14+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/imprinting_review/","section":"publication","summary":"Genomic imprinting refers to a pattern of gene expression in which a specific parent's allele is either under-expressed or completely silenced.

Here, we critically evaluate previously proposed evolutionary benefits of imprinting and suggest some additional ones. We discuss whether each benefit is capable of explaining both the origin and maintenance of imprinting, and examine how the different benefits interact. We then outline the many costs of imprinting. Simple models show that circulating deleterious recessives can prevent the initial spread of imprinting, even if imprinting would be evolutionarily stable if it could persist long enough to purge these. We also show that imprinting can raise or lower the mutation load, depending on the selective regime and the degree of dominance. We finish by discussing the population-level consequences of imprinting, which can be both positive and negative. Imprinting offers many insights into evolutionary conflict, the interaction between individual- and population-level fitness effects, and the 'gene's-eye view' of evolution.","tags":["Evolutionary conflict","Theoretical model"],"title":"The evolution of genomic imprinting: Costs, benefits and long-term consequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Andrew T.

This constraint is part of a wider phenomenon that I term 'caste load', which is defined as the decline in mean fitness caused by caste-specific selection pressures, that is, differential selection on breeding and nonbreeding individuals. I elaborate the caste load hypothesis using quantitative and population genetic arguments and individual-based simulations. Although selection can sometimes erode genetic correlations and resolve caste load, this may be constrained when mutations have similar pleiotropic effects on breeder and helper traits. I document evidence for caste load, identify putative genomic adaptations to it, and suggest future research directions.

Cooperation based on genetic recognition cues is paradoxical because it disproportionately benefits individuals with common phenotypes, which should erode the required cue polymorphism. Theoretical models suggest that many recognition loci likely have some secondary function that is subject to diversifying selection, keeping them variable. Here, we use individual-based simulations to investigate the hypothesis that the dual use of recognition cues to facilitate social behaviour and disassortative mating (e.g. for inbreeding avoidance) can maintain cue diversity over evolutionary time. Our model shows that when organisms mate disassortatively with respect to their recognition cues, cooperation and recognition locus diversity can persist at high values, especially when outcrossed matings produce more surviving offspring. Mating system affects cue diversity via at least four distinct mechanisms, and its effects interact with other parameters such as population structure. Also, the attrition of cue diversity is less rapid when cooperation does not require an exact cue match. Using a literature review, we show that there is abundant empirical evidence that heritable recognition cues are simultaneously used in social and sexual behaviour. Our models show that mate choice is one possible resolution of the paradox of genetic kin recognition, and the literature review suggests that genetic recognition cues simultaneously inform assortative cooperation and disassortative mating in a large range of taxa. However, direct evidence is scant and there is substantial scope for future work.","tags":["Social insects","Theoretical model"],"title":"Crozier’s paradox revisited: maintenance of genetic recognition systems by disassortative mating","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Timothy A.

We found multiple lines of evidence that cuticular hydrocarbon production is genetically correlated with oogenesis and that the queen pheromone 3-methylhentriacontane and other 3-methylalkanes have strong genetic links with fertility relative to other cuticular hydrocarbons.

Here, we review existing information on how female fitness evolves under polyandry and how this influences population dynamics. In balance, it is far from clear whether polyandry has a net positive or negative effect on female fitness, but we also stress that its effects on individuals may not have visible demographic consequences.

The model reaffirms that cheap and costly signals can both be honest, and predicts that expensive signals should have more positive allometric slopes than cheap ones. The new framework is applied to an experimental study of an ant queen pheromone that honestly signals fecundity. Juvenile hormone was found to have opposing, dose‐dependent effects on pheromone production and fecundity and was fatal at high doses, indicating that endocrine‐mediated trade‐offs preclude dishonesty. Several lines of evidence suggest that the realized cost of pheromone production may be nontrivial, and the antagonistic effects of juvenile hormone indicate the presence of significant evolutionary constraints.

The results suggest that males terminally invest in both short‐ and medium‐range pheromones when they perceive reduced future survival. Moreover, the constitutive and inducible aspects of male and female CHC production are consistent with sex‐specific selection on the signalling and defensive functions of CHCs. The implications of terminal investment for ‘dishonest’ signalling and the efficacy of sexual selection are discussed.","tags":["Sexual selection","Immunity"],"title":"Terminal investment in multiple sexual signals: immune‐challenged males produce more attractive pheromones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nick Bos","Lena Grinsted","Luke Holman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1303972356,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1303972356,"objectID":"aa398775788c307cf4f6f4d0345cecec","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/publication/wax_on_wax_off/","publishdate":"2011-04-28T16:32:36+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wax_on_wax_off/","section":"publication","summary":"Social animals use recognition cues to discriminate between group members and non-members. These recognition cues may be conceptualized as a label, which is compared to a neural representation of acceptable cue combinations termed the template. In ants and other social insects, the label consists of a waxy layer of colony-specific hydrocarbons on the body surface. Genetic and environmental differences between colony members may confound recognition and social cohesion, so many species perform behaviors that homogenize the odor label, such as mouth-to-mouth feeding and allogrooming. Here, we test for another mechanism of cue exchange: indirect transfer of cuticular hydrocarbons via the nest material. Using a combination of chemical analysis and behavioral experiments with _Camponotus aethiops_ ants, we show that nest soil indirectly transfers hydrocarbons between ants and affects recognition behavior. We also found evidence that olfactory cues on the nest soil influence nestmate recognition, but this effect was not observed in all colonies. These results demonstrate that cuticular hydrocarbons deposited on the nest soil are important in creating uniformity in the odor label and may also contribute to the template.","tags":["Social insects"],"title":"Wax on, wax off: Nest soil facilitates indirect transfer of recognition cues between ant nestmates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacobus J.

Social insects possess especially sophisticated chemical communication systems that govern every aspect of colony life, including the defining feature of eusociality: reproductive division of labor. Current evidence hints at the central importance of queen pheromones, but progress has been hindered by the fact that such pheromones have only been isolated in honeybees. In a pair of papers on the ant Lasius niger, we identified and investigated a queen pheromone regulating worker sterility. The cuticular hydrocarbon 3-methylhentriacontane (3-MeC31) is correlated with queen maturity and fecundity, and workers are also more likely to execute surplus queens that have low amounts of this chemical. Experiments with synthetic 3-MeC31 found that it inhibits ovarian development in queenless workers and lowers worker aggression towards objects coated with it. Production of 3-MeC31 by queens was depressed by an experimental immune challenge, and the same chemical was abundant on queen-laid eggs, suggesting that the workers’ responses to the queen are conditional on her health and fecundity. Together with other studies, these results indicate that queen pheromones are honest signals of quality that simultaneously regulate multiple social behaviors.","tags":["Social insects","Queen pheromones"],"title":"Queen pheromones: The chemical crown governing insect social life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Charlotte G.

Ordinarily sterile workers can usually reproduce given the right conditions, so the factors regulating reproductive division of labour may provide insight into why eusociality has persisted over evolutionary time. Queen-produced pheromones that affect worker reproduction have been implicated in diverse taxa, including ants, termites, wasps and possibly mole rats, but to date have only been definitively identified in the honeybee. Using the black garden ant Lasius niger, we isolate the first sterility-regulating ant queen pheromone. The pheromone is a cuticular hydrocarbon that comprises the majority of the chemical profile of queens and their eggs, and also affects worker behaviour, by reducing aggression towards objects bearing the pheromone. We further show that the pheromone elicits a strong response in worker antennae and that its production by queens is selectively reduced following an immune challenge. These results suggest that the pheromone has a central role in colony organization and support the hypothesis that worker sterility represents altruistic self-restraint in response to an honest quality signal.","tags":["Social insects","Queen pheromones","Immunity"],"title":"Identification of an ant queen pheromone regulating worker sterility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Stephanie Dreier","Patrizia d'Ettorre"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1267338894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1267338894,"objectID":"c98d48879411e92c9233866a205e4dc0","permalink":"https://www.lukeholman.org/publication/lasius_polygyny_proc_b/","publishdate":"2010-02-28T16:34:54+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lasius_polygyny_proc_b/","section":"publication","summary":"Social insects offer unique opportunities to test predictions regarding the evolution of cooperation, life histories and communication. Colony founding by groups of unrelated queens, some of which are later killed, may select for selfish reproductive strategies, honest signalling and punishment. Here, we use a brood transfer experiment to test whether cofounding queens of the ant Lasius niger ‘selfishly’ adjust their productivity when sharing the nest with future competitors. We simultaneously analysed queen cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles to investigate whether queens honestly signal their reproductive output or produce dishonest, manipulative signals, providing a novel test of the evolutionary significance of queen pheromones. Queens produced fewer workers when their colony contained ample brood, but only in the presence of competitors, suggesting selfish conservation of resources. Several CHCs correlated with reproductive maturation, and to a lesser extent with productivity; the same hydrocarbons were more abundant on queens that were not killed, suggesting that workers select productive queens using these chemical cues.

In the present paper, I review the major findings of ecology and evolution studies employing sperm viability staining and outline the method’s principle limitations. The key problem is that the viability assay may itself kill sperm, which is likely to confound many common experimental designs in addition to producing artificially low estimates of sperm viability. I further suggest that sperm number should be routinely measured in sperm viability studies, as it may be an important but overlooked source of spurious results.

Seminal fluid typically contains a diverse range of chemicals that coordinate sperm storage, moderate sperm motility, provide advantages in sexual selection and influence female physiology. Seminal fluid is well‐studied in _Drosophila melanogaster_, a species in which it has been suggested to 'incapacitate' the sperm of rival males (e.g. by killing them) and thereby provide an advantage in sperm competition. This hypothesis has been tested several times over many years, but different studies have yielded conflicting conclusions. Here, I use fluorescent staining to directly measure the effects of _D. melanogaster_ seminal fluid on the survival of sperm from the same male or from a rival. The results suggest that seminal fluid improves sperm survival, even if the sperm are from a different male. This study therefore provides strong evidence that seminal fluid does not kill rival sperm, and instead can actually protect them. This study also tested whether chemicals in the female reproductive tract harm sperm as in another _Drosophila_ species, but found no evidence of this. These findings suggest that residual seminal fluid inside females could benefit the sperm of subsequent mates, affecting the outcome of sperm competition and influencing the evolution of ejaculates and mating systems.","tags":["Sexual selection","Sperm","Drosophila"],"title":"Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid can protect the sperm of other males","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My PhD research focused on the evolution of sperm morphology, especially in the obscura sub-genus of Drosophila.

One such adaptation may be the enigmatic infertile sperm morphs or 'parasperm' produced by many species, which have been hypothesized to protect their fertile brother 'eusperm' from spermicide. Here, we show that female Drosophila pseudoobscura reproductive tracts are spermicidal and that the survival of eusperm after exposure to the female tract is highest when males produce many parasperm. This study clarifies the adaptive significance of infertile sperm castes, which has remained elusive in _Drosophila_ and other taxa despite much recent interest We suggest that spermicide and male countermeasures against it are more common than is appreciated currently and discuss how spermicide could drive the evolution of several key male traits, including sperm size and number.","tags":["Sexual selection","Sperm","Drosophila"],"title":"A sterile sperm caste protects brother fertile sperm from female-mediated death in Drosophila pseudoobscura","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luke Holman","Robert P.

Parasperm have been hypothesized to perform a number of roles in place of fertilization, predominantly focused on their potential function in postcopulatory sexual selection. However, the evolutionary significance of parasperm remains unknown. Here we measured several male and female morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits in 13 obscura group species to test competing hypotheses of parasperm function using comparative methods. We found that parasperm size was unrelated to female reproductive tract morphology but was negatively related to our two indices of sperm competition, suggesting that postcopulatory sexual selection may indeed have shaped the evolution of parasperm. We also found abundant coevolution between male and female reproductive traits. Some of these relationships have been found in both spermmonomorphic and sperm-heteromorphic taxa, but others are dissimilar.

One type of within‐individual sperm variation is sperm heteromorphism, in which each male produces two or more distinct types of sperm simultaneously, only one of which is typically fertile (the 'eusperm'). The adaptive significance of nonfertile 'parasperm' types is poorly understood, although numerous sperm‐heteromorphic species are known from many disparate taxa. This paper examines in detail two female‐centred hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of this unconventional sperm production strategy. First, we use game theoretical models to establish that parasperm may function to protect eusperm from female‐generated spermicide, and to elucidate the predictions of this idea. Second, we expand on the relatively undeveloped idea that parasperm are used by females as a criterion for cryptic female choice, and discuss the predictions generated by this idea compared to other hypotheses proposed to explain sperm heteromorphism. We critically evaluate both hypotheses, suggest ways in which they could be tested, and propose taxa in which they could be important.","tags":["Sperm","Sexual selection","Theoretical model"],"title":"Spermicide, cryptic female choice and the evolution of sperm form and function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Sadd","Luke Holman","Helen Armitage","Fiona Lock","Rachel Marland","Michael T.

For the males of many species fitness is determined by qualitative and quantitative aspects of costly sexual signals: The notion that epigamic traits are costly forms the cornerstone of those theories that propose parasites drive sexual selection. Consequently studies examining this notion assume sexual signalling is honest (i.e. driven by cost) when they seek to identify correlations or causal links between male immune function and attractiveness. We demonstrate that immune challenged males of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, increased their investment in epigamic pheromone signals: these males became significantly more attractive to females whilst increasing the activity of a key immune effector system. In other words males increase terminal reproductive effort (invest in attractiveness) in response to a survival threat (immune insult). Consequently the signal preferred by the female is dishonest when considering the male's condition.","tags":["Sexual selection","Immunity"],"title":"Modulation of sexual signalling by immune challenged male mealworm beetles (Tenebrio molitor, L.): evidence for terminal investment and dishonesty","type":"publication"}]
